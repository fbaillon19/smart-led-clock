## Advanced Debugging

### Serial Debugging

**Enable verbose output:**
```cpp
// In config.h
#define DEBUG_MODE true

// In code
#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
  Serial.println("Debug: Variable value = " + String(value));
#endif
```

**Serial output tips:**
- Use meaningful messages: "WiFi connected" not just "OK"
- Print variable values: Serial.print("Temp: "); Serial.println(temp);
- Use timestamps: Serial.print(millis()); Serial.print(": Message");
- Flush buffer when needed: Serial.flush();

---

### Memory Debugging

**Check free memory (AVR):**
```cpp
int freeRAM() {
  extern int __heap_start, *__brkval;
  int v;
  return (int) &v - (__brkval == 0 ? (int) &__heap_start : (int) __brkval);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.print("Free RAM: ");
  Serial.println(freeRAM());
}
```

**Memory leak detection:**
1. Monitor free RAM over time
2. Should remain stable
3. Decreasing = potential memory leak
4. Check for missing free() calls
5. Avoid String class (use char arrays)

---

### I2C Debugging

**I2C Scanner Sketch:**
```cpp
#include <Wire.h>

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("I2C Scanner");
}

void loop() {
  byte error, address;
  int nDevices = 0;

  for(address = 1; address < 127; address++ ) {
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    error = Wire.endTransmission();

    if (error == 0) {
      Serial.print("Device at 0x");
      if (address<16) Serial.print("0");
      Serial.println(address,HEX);
      nDevices++;
    }
  }
  
  if (nDevices == 0) {
    Serial.println("No I2C devices found");
  }
  
  delay(5000);
}
```

**Common I2C addresses:**
- 0x27 or 0x3F: LCD
- 0x68: DS3231 RTC
- 0x76 or 0x77: BME280 (if used)
